# FIL - Find Info Lausanne

FIL is a mobile website that helps you find social centers in Lausanne, Switzerland. It was created in 2 weeks during our fullstack dev bootcamp at [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/)

## Overview

### The challenge

It's currently difficult for people in need to find information about social infrastructures in Lausanne. The information is either found on various printed medias which are not always up to date or scattered across the web. On top of that, language can be a barrier for most of these people. FIL is here to gather all the information in one place and makes it easy for everyone to access it.

- Navigate the website in your preferred language
